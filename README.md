# Dreamlands - A Lovecraftian Arena game
The first thing you need to know is that this game isn't quite complete--it is in the process of being worked on. However, it IS in a functioning state... just not where I want it to be.

This is a spin on the classic arena style game. You create a character and go toe-to-toe with enemies that are randomized depending on your level.

There's supposed to be a whole story arc, bosses, abilities AND an inventory system, but I haven't quite gotten around to those. I will do so ASAP.

Also, please note, the images here are placeholders. I don't own any of them and will be replacing them with my own things. Owing to time constraints, however, I chose to focus on the game function.

## Build Status
In progress.

Needs added:
- Ability system
- Inventory system
- Bosses
- Story
- Original images

## Languages Used
HTML, CSS, JQuery, Javascript

## Motivation
Completed as an assignment for UCLA Coding Bootcamp. Mixed things up quite a bit to entertain myself. Chose Lovecraft because it was easiest to create a list of enemies to fight.
