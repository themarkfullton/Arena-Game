# Dreamlands - A Lovecraftian Arena game

**Link to Live:** https://themarkfullton.github.io/Arena-Game/

This is a spin on the classic arena style game. You create a character and go toe-to-toe with enemies that are randomized depending on your level.

There's supposed to be a whole story arc, bosses, abilities AND an inventory system, but I haven't quite gotten around to those. I will do so ASAP.

Also, please note, the images here are placeholders. I don't own any of them and will be replacing them with my own things. Owing to time constraints, however, I chose to focus on the game function.

## Build Status

In progress.

Needs added:

- Ability system
- Inventory system
- Bosses
- Story
- Original images

## Languages Used

HTML, CSS, JQuery, Javascript

## Motivation

Created during the coronavirus quarantine as a way to amuse my friends (big Lovecraft buffs).
