==========================[HEIR - INTRO]=========================================================

"For your protection, avoid your own reflection."

It was the family mantra. Ever since you were young, your parents had drilled it into you. When you noticed the new mirror tucked close by the scene of their "suicide", then, you became suspicious. 

Officials were quick to admit the situation was odd--both husband and wife gone at the same moment; with no physical cause of death--but could offer neither explaination nor time to uncovering the truth. For a day or two, you tried to move on, but the mystery continued to eat away at you. You always returned to that curiousity, that sinister mirror.

Eventually, you gave into your curiousity. After a few glasses of wine to dull your nerves, you took the mirror into your hands and willingly broke the family rule: You stared right at your reflection.

The world fades from view.

==========================[HEIR - LEVEL 1 INTRO]=========================================================

Feeling a brush of cold wind, you awaken. 

You're standing in an ancient forest... with no sky. Gnarled roots twist from the soil, only to meet with a languid, green pool of water swirling overhead. Black shadows twist through the fathomless ceiling of water.

<< HEIR : I'm no dendrologist, but I'm certain trees don't normally work that way...
        : Must be the wine...>>

Suddenly, the heavy prickle of a lurking gaze chills your flesh, cutting all observation short.

==========================[OUTLAW - INTRO]=========================================================

It was called the Jewel of the North. Apparently, an exploration team had unearthed it in the arctic; no one knows for certain, however, as only one man returned back from the trip and he has hence refused to speak--of the trip or anything.

The curse following about the crystal, of course, only made it that much more valuable in the eyes of those with more money than wit. It was sold to a fellow for an obscene amount and YOU were paid even more by a third party to "take it off his hands."

Though the man's estate was renown for its security, you managed to outwit every trap and obstacle it had to offer--you're well worth every cent spent--and stood before the crystal in less than an hour.

Something about the jewel set your hackles on edge. Queer figures were carved onto the surface; figures with the bodies of men and the faces of... God knows what. As your hand draws nearer, you feel a faint vibration and hesitate... before remembering that time is of the essence.

You snatch the jewel and the world fades.


==========================[OUTLAW - LEVEL 1 INTRO]=========================================================

Feeling a brush of cold wind, you awaken. 

You're standing in an ancient forest... with no sky. Gnarled roots twist from the soil, only to meet with a languid, green pool of water swirling overhead. Black shadows twist through the fathomless ceiling of water.

<< OUTLAW : A fairer sight than prison bars at least.>>

Suddenly, the heavy prickle of a lurking gaze chills your flesh, cutting all observation short.

==========================[ALL - FIRST SHOPKEEP - 1]=========================================================

As you lean over and try to catch your breath, you notice a shadow twisting itself about your ankle.

<< HEIR : Oh no you don't--!!!>>

Though the tendril disappears when you shake your leg, you feel a new shade slithering up your arm. The more you try to shake the stuff off, the more it begins to engulf you.

After encasing the rest of your body, the formless creature twists itself up your nostrils.

You black out.

==========================[ALL - FIRST SHOPKEEP - 2]=========================================================

When you come to, you notice a paunchy fellow huffing as he lifts a crate up to place it on a makeshift counter. Though you try, your mind refuses to register your surroundings. All you can process is the shady shop sitting before you.

With a grunt, the fellow slaps the crate on the counter.

<< SHOPKEEPER : Come now, NAME. Are you truly going to stand by and watch while a friendly face suffers? Do lend a hand! >>

<< HEIR : Do I know you? >>

<< SHOPKEEPER : Of course--though you often pretend not to. I'm the part of you that you wish to forget; the part who takes what they want and wants what they can't have. Normally you CAN just ignore me, but in a place like this... >>

The man clicks his tongue and passes you the slyest of grins, red eyes a glitter.

<< HEIR : You know where we are, then? >>

<< SHOPKEEPER : Of course, though it's in my best interests not to tell you; the moment you know, you'll just go back to ignoring me. >>

The shady fellow indicates another box to his right.

<< SHOPKEEPER : Now, if you'd please lend yourself a hand... >>

==========================[ALL - FIRST SHOPKEEP - 3]=========================================================

<< SHOPKEEPER : As our lives are tied together, it IS in my best interest to save yours... Please take a look through my wares. If there's anything you need, I'd be more than happy to hand it over--for a price, of course. >>

==========================[ ALL - END OF LEVEL 1 ]=========================================================

<< A marked improvement upon your last kill. >>

At first, the words are without a face. Gradually, however, a pair of eyes materialize from the foilage. Then a deer-like head. Then a humanoid body. You take a step back and ready an attack.

The creature merely laughs.

<< Nodens: Ah; but the dying embers within you are growing into a flame. The heat is weak, but growing; welcome back, dear hunter. I am Nodens, Elder God and master of the hunt. You need not introduce yourself, NAME, for it was my hand that made you. >>

The creature takes a step closer; you take several back.

<< Nodens: Brave, my dear hunter, but stupid. Smart of you to realize defeating me is your only way out of here; dumb of you to think you have the power to do so. >>

Something in you agrees with Noden's claim; you lower your weapon.

==========================[ ALL - END OF LEVEL 2 ]=========================================================

<< YOU : There IS a way out then? >>


<< Nodens: Certainly; you need only remember yourself. Your TRUE self, that is, not the one forced upon you. Break free of the chains put upon you by your prey. For so long you have lowered yourself to civilize with them; it is time you rise again to the heights upon which I created you. >>

<< YOU : And how do I do that exactly? >>

<< Nodens: By collecting souls, of course. And not just any soul will do; you need the soul of another hunter. >>

<< YOU : Right. And I find one of those... how? >>

<< Nodens: You don't FIND one; you have to hunt one down. When I feel you can handle it, I'll connect your path with that of a fellow hunter. Then, it's hunt--or be hunted. >>

Without giving you a chance to reply, Nodens fades from view. In his stead stands what can only be another "hunter"...
