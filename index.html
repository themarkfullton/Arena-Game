            <p>Every night when we close our eyes, we begin a journey to an alternate—and eerie—universe. Those who remember such a journey can only refer to this universe under a cryptic name: The Dreamlands.</p>

            <p>Occupying these lands are all manner of hellish creature, foreign architecture, and long-forgotten secrets. Treasure abounds in these lands—but only for those full-witted enough to seek it out. Death in these lands, after all, means a severing with one’s physical body.</p>

            <p>Though you have met with many warnings, you have heeded none of them. For one reason or another, you have made your way into these Dreamlands. Can you survive them?</p>
