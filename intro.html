                    <p>It was called the Jewel of the North. Apparently, an exploration team had unearthed it in the arctic; no one knows for certain, however, as only one man returned back from the trip and he has hence refused to speak--of the trip or anything.</p>

                    <p>The curse following about the crystal, of course, only made it that much more valuable in the eyes of those with more money than wit. It was sold to a fellow for an obscene amount and YOU were paid even more by a third party to "take it off his hands."</p>
                    
                    <p>Though the man's estate was renown for its security, you managed to outwit every trap and obstacle it had to offer--you're well worth every cent spent--and stood before the crystal in less than an hour.</p>
                    
                    <p>Something about the jewel set your hackles on edge. Queer figures were carved onto the surface; figures with the bodies of men and the faces of... God knows what. As your hand draws nearer, you feel a faint vibration and hesitate... before remembering that time is of the essence.</p>
                    
                    <p>You snatch the jewel and the world fades.</p>
